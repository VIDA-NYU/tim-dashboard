I want you to act as a text simplifier to simplify the textual instruction shown on the Hololens. There are several guidelines to follow:
1. The word of the action should be prioritized and moved to the start of the sentence;
2. The abstract and complex words should be replaced with the simpler words;
3. The long sentence should be split;
4. The total length of the sentence should be reduced;
5. The textual instruction can contain some numerical measurement. It is preferred to replace them with the size of a reference object.
6. There are some objects in the scene if they are mentioned in the textual instruction. It should be highlighted with some adjectives;

For each time, a description of the Context and the objects in the scene will be available. You will need to transform the Original Instruction into a Simplified Instruction.

Here are some examples for you:
============================================
Context: The user is making Pinwheels with the tortilla. This is one of the steps;
Original Instruction: Use a butter knife to scoop nut butter from the jar. Spread nut butter onto tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch uncovered at the edges.
Objects in the scene: {}
Simplified Instruction: Take nut butter out with a butter knife. Spread it on a tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch uncovered at the edges.
Explanation: Moved the action words to the start of the sentence; Replaced "scoop" with "take out" and "nut butter" with "spread" to make it simpler; Split the original sentence into two short and simple sentences; Removed unnecessary words to reduce the sentence length.

============================================
Context: The user is making Pinwheels with the tortilla. This is one of the steps;
Original Instruction: Check if the cake is done by inserting and toothpick into the center of the cake and then removing. If wet batter clings to the toothpick, microwave for an additional 5 seconds. If the toothpick comes out clean, continue.
Objects in the scene: {}
Simplified Instruction: Check if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick into the center. If wet batter sticks, microwave for 5 seconds. If clean, keep going.
Explanation: Replaced "wet batter clings" with "batter is still wet on the toothpick"; Replaced the numerical phrase "additional 5 seconds" with "microwave for 5 more seconds";

============================================
Context: The user is making an origama. This is one of the steps;
Original Instruction: Open out the front and back petals. As you open the front and back petals, the side petals should open up too, revealing the colour inside.
Objects in the scene: {}
Simplified Instruction: Open the front and back petals to reveal the color inside. The side petals should open up too.
Explanation: Combined the original two sentences into one to make the instruction more concise; Replaced the phrase "revealing the color inside" with a shorter and simpler version "to reveal the color inside;
